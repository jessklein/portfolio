                    <p>I currently live in Barre, Vermont, but I'm interested in relocating to the Herndon, Virginia area to pursue a wider variety of job opportunities that more closely align with my interests and skills than are available in my current location. I've visited the area numerous times in the past to visit friends and family and enjoyed it immensely, so I'm looking forward to finding an opportunity to be closer to loved ones while developing my career in a discipline that I find both challenging and enjoyable. Hopefully you're here to help me find the right fit!</p>
                    <p>I have several years of experience in front-end web development, and I'm very interested in filling in gaps in my experience and expanding my knowledge to include other development disciplines. Currently, I'm in the process of learning full-stack development with a focus on LAMP stack development and building a portfolio to showcase my progress. Other topics of interest include: .NET, ASP, and others.</p>

                <p>Projects below include gaming community sites and WordPress themes. My work on these projects included developing mock-ups and wireframes, generating composite branding images and .psd files, and converting mock-ups and screenshots into fully coded and functional sites and WordPress themes.</p>
